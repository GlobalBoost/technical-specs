# Tech Stack Specification

## Backend

- Blockchain Framework: [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) (open-source modular blockchain framework)
- Smart Contract Language: [Ink](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) (Rust-based language for writing smart contracts on Substrate)
- Solidity: In addition to Ink as desscribed above we can use solidity to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Substrate also supports Solidity, allowing developers to port their Ethereum smart contracts to Substrate-based blockchains. Impact is EVM compatible
- Web Framework: [Rust Actix-Web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) (web framework for Rust programming language)
- Database: [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) (key-value store optimized for solid-state drives)
- Web3 API: [Substrate API](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/substrate-api) (set of RESTful endpoints for interacting with Substrate-based blockchains)
- Middleware: [Substrate Toolbox](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-toolbox) (collection of tools for managing and monitoring Substrate-based blockchains)

## Frontend

- Web Framework: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- State Management: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (JavaScript library for managing application state)
- UI Framework: [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) (React-based UI component library)
- Web3 Library: [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) (JavaScript library for interacting with Web3 APIs)
- Testing Framework: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (JavaScript testing frameworks)

## DevOps

- Containerization: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (open-source platform for containerization)
- Orchestration: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (open-source container orchestration system)
- CI/CD: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (GitHub's built-in CI/CD platform)
- Monitoring: [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (open-source monitoring and visualization tools)

## Security
- Cryptography: SHA-256, ED25519, BLS12-381 (cryptographic algorithms used in Substrate)
- Privacy: Zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures (privacy-enhancing technologies used in Substrate)
- Identity: Decentralized identity (DID), self-sovereign identity (SSI) (identity management approaches used in blockchain)

## Other Tools

- Version Control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (distributed version control system)
- Project Management: [Project](https://www.github.com)
- Communication: [Signal](https://signal.org/en/download/), [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) (communication tools for teams)
